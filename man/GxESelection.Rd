\description{
Variable selection for a marble object
}
\details{
For class `Sparse',  the inclusion probability is used to indicate the importance of predictors. 
Here we use a binary indicator \eqn{\phi} to denote that the membership of the non-spike distribution. 
Take the main effect of the \eqn{j}th genetic factor, \eqn{X_{j}}, as an example. 
Suppose we have collected H posterior samples from MCMC after burn-ins. The \eqn{j}th G factor is included 
in the marginal G\eqn{\times}E model at the \eqn{j}th MCMC iteration if the corresponding indicator is 1, i.e., \eqn{\phi_j^{(h)} = 1}. 
Subsequently, the posterior probability of retaining the \eqn{j}th genetic main effect in the final marginal model is defined as the average of all the indicators for the \eqn{j}th G factor among the H posterior samples. 
That is, \eqn{p_j = \hat{\pi} (\phi_j = 1|y) = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \phi_j^{(h)}, \;  j = 1, \dots,p.}
A larger posterior inclusion probability of \eqn{j}th indicates a stronger empirical evidence that the \eqn{j}th genetic main effect has a non-zero coefficient, i.e., a stronger association with the phenotypic trait. 
Here, we use 0.5 as a cutting-off point. If \eqn{p_j > 0.5}, then the \eqn{j}th genetic main effect is included in the final model. Otherwise, the \eqn{j}th genetic main effect is excluded in the final model.
For class `NonSparse', variable selection is based on 95\% credible interval.
Please check the references for more details about the variable selection.
