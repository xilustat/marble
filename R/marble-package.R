#' @title  Robust Marginal Bayesian Variable Selection for Gene-Environment Interactions
#' @aliases marble-package
#' @description In this package, we provide a set of robust marginal Bayesian variable selection methods for gene-environment interaction analysis. A Bayesian formulation of the quantile regression has been adopted to accommodate data contamination and heavy-tailed distributions in the response. The proposed method conducts a robust marginal variable selection by accounting for structural sparsity. In particular, the spike-and-slab priors are imposed to identify important main and interaction effects.
#' In addition to the default method, users can also choose different structures (robust or non-robust), methods without spike-and-slab priors.
#'
#' @details The user friendly, integrated interface \strong{marble()} allows users to flexibly choose the fitting methods they prefer. There are two arguments in marble() that control the fitting method:
#' robust: whether to use robust methods; sparse: whether to use the spike-and-slab priors to create sparsity.
#' The function marble() returns a marble object that contains the posterior estimates of each coefficients. Moreover, it also provides a rank list of the genetic factors and gene-environment interactions.
#' Functions GxESelection() and print() are implemented for marble objects.
#' GxESelection() takes a marble object and returns the variable selection results.
