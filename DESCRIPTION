Description: Recently, multiple marginal variable selection methods have been developed and shown to be effective in Gene-Environment interactions studies. We propose a novel marginal Bayesian variable selection method for Gene-Environment interactions studies. In particular, our marginal Bayesian method is robust to data contamination and outliers in the outcome variables. With the incorporation of spike-and-slab priors, we have implemented the Gibbs sampler based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The core algorithms of the package have been developed in 'C++'.
