Title: Robust Marginal Bayesian Variable Selection for Gene-Environment Interactions
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Xi Lu, Cen Wu

Description: Recently, multiple marginal variable selection methods have been developed and shown to be 
             effective in Gene-Environment interactions studies. We propose a novel marginal Bayesian 
             variable selection method for Gene-Environment interactions studies. In particular, our 
             marginal Bayesian method is robust to data contamination and outliers in the outcome 
             variables. With the incorporation of spike-and-slab priors, we have implemented the Gibbs 
             sampler based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The core algorithms of the package have 
             been developed in C++.
